# Data Structures & Algorithms — Java Implementations

A collection of fundamental **Data Structures implemented from scratch in Java**, designed to help strengthen understanding of core concepts, improve algorithmic thinking, and prepare for technical interviews.

This repository showcases classic data structure implementations with clear structure and basic documentation, ideal for learning and reference.

## 📖 About

Learning data structures from scratch helps you understand how built-in collections and APIs work internally. Knowing these implementations strengthens your grasp on performance trade-offs and prepares you for interview questions and real-world coding challenges. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DINOSH-M/Data-Structures.git
Open the project in your Java IDE
You can use IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code, or any editor of your choice.

Compile & Run
Navigate to an implementation folder (for example linkedlist/) and compile:


javac SinglyLinkedList.java
java SinglyLinkedList
Explore & Learn

Each folder contains classes and examples demonstrating how the data structure works.
